\problem{3}

Let $x[n]$ be a 1-D signal that represents grayscale colors as pixel intensities (0 is black and 255 is white):
\[
x[n] = [\,50,\;100,\;240,\;255,\;200,\;120,\;80,\;80,\;90,\;150,\;220,\;240\,],
\qquad 0\le n\le 11.
\]
Assume causal zero-padding outside the given range, that is, $x[n]=0$ for $n<0$ or $n>11$. Your goal is to compute $y[n]$ by hand and also using a for loop implementation (in Python or MATLAB) of the convolution sum. \textbf{You are not allowed to use external libraries to compute the convolution.}

Consider these physically meaningful impulse responses $h[\cdot]$ (all causal) of LTI systems:

\problempart [12 points] A blurring system:
\[
h[n]=\tfrac13\,[\,\delta[n]+\delta[n-1]+\delta[n-2]\,]
\]

\problempart [12 points] A first-difference (edge detector):
\[
h[n]=\delta[n]-\delta[n-1],
\]

\problempart [12 points] Exponential smoothing
\[
h[n]=[\,0.6,\;0.3,\;0.1\,]\text{ for }n=0,1,2, \text{ else }0.
\]

For each of the parts above, 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item By hand, write the convolution sum for $y[n]$ and compute numerically $y[n]$ at $n=0,1,2$.
  \item Implement a for loop that computes $y[n]$ for all $n$ for system above. Make sure to plot the original $x[n]$ and each $y[n]$ on the same axes.
  \item Apply repeated convolution to intensify the effect of the system. You can choose one of the systems above and experiment with repeated convolutions.
\end{enumerate}

\problempart [1 point] How long did this assignment take you to complete (this does not include the time spent in lectures or in labs, but it does include the time spent programming).
