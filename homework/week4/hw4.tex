\begin{document}
\problem{1}
A system responds to an impulse input $\delta(t)$ in an exponentially decaying manner. So, the impulse response of the system is given by:
\[
h(t) = e^{-2t}u(t)
\]
where $u(t)$ is the unit step function.

\problempart[5 points] What is the output $y(t)$ of the system when the input is $x(t) = k \delta(t)$, where $k$ is a constant?

\problempart[5 points] Prove that the system is linear and time-invariant. 

Hint: For an impulse input $\delta(t)$, the output is $h(t)$. What is the output when the input is $\delta(t - t_0)$? Use this to prove time-invariance. For linearity, use the properties of the delta function.

\problempart[10 points] What is the output $y(t)$ of the system when the input is $x(t) = u(t)$? You must find this by starting from the relationship between the step signal and the impulse signal (from HW 2): 
\[
u(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} \delta(\tau) d\tau
\]


\problempart[20 points] Find the output $y(t)$ of the system when the input is a pulse signal of amplitude $A$ and duration $\tau$:

\[
x(t) = A[u(t) - u(t-\tau)]
\]
